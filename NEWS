## Features

1. Implemented `read_gtf`, `read_gff`, `read_bed` and `read_bam` methods for

formats by automatically recognising the extension and reading these files.

4. Added `as_granges()` to convert `gtf/gff/bed/bam` objects to GRanges 
object for further use with Bioconductor packages.

5. Added `construct_introns` to fill gaps in gene annotation and fill missing 
feature from `gtf/gff` objects.

6. Exported `tidy` function in case user wants to do decide on which columns 
to retain on tidying.
